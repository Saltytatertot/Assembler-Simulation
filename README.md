# Assembler-Simulation
By using opcodes, can simulate the memory registers and the hexadecimal values stored with in them. 




Assembler Part 2: legv8 Assembler

Computation on legv8 Assembly instructions including:

MOV LSL
ADDI
STUR
LDUR
CBZ
B
ADD
SUB
ORR
AND



Outputs the address the instruction is stored in and the machine code output after.
It should be robust enough to notice simple errors in input from the file, and not output anything
in that case.



The source code is stored in Form1.cs
Things start breaking when its named something else but this will do for now.



HOW TO RUN:
To run, extract the folder from the .zip,
and run the Assembler.exe
and choose the legv8CodeOnlyR.txt file for the example output.



It will output the file "AssemblerOutput.txt" file to observe what the program output.
